## Eniko Szekely

I am a senior data scientist at the Swiss Data Science Center since September 2017. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, working on machine learning for dynamical systems and climate science. I obtained my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Geneva, Switzerland (2011), the MSc from Telecom Bretagne, France (2006) and the BSc from the University of Timisoara, Romania (2005). Broadly I am interested in machine learning for nonlinear phenomena and high-dimensional data, and more recently I have been working on using machine learning and statistical learning approaches to advance our understanding of the climate.
