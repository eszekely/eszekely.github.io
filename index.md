I am a senior data scientist at the Swiss Data Science Center, EPFL and ETH Zürich. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, working on machine learning for dynamical systems and climate science. Broadly I am interested in machine learning for nonlinear phenomena, and more recently I have been working on using statistical learning and machine learning approaches to advance our understanding of the climate. 

**Fields of interest**: machine learning, statistical learning, dynamical systems, causality, climate science

**Activities**: [Climate Informatics Conference](https://ci2020.web.ox.ac.uk/) (Steering committee), [Environmental Data Science](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environmental-data-science) (Editor) 

**Short read on current work**: [Detection and attribution of climate change](https://datascience.ch/climate-is-what-you-expect-weather-is-what-you-get/)
